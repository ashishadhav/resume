		\begin{cvsubsection}{Projects}{}{}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Detecting TLS misconfiguration in Android Apps using dynamic analysis : Univ of Florida} (2016).Developed a framework to analyze android apps at runtime in Python, solving the android app attribution problem. Detected client \& server side SSL/TLS security issues of apps and third party libraries, making them MITM vulnerable.
				\item \textbf{Cloud Edge Beneath Architecture Based IOT system : Univ of Florida} (2016).  Implemented the Restful Edge layer interface in Golang and Distributed device drivers for sensors on BBB in Xinu. The Edge served as the Command and Control center for the IOT subsystem \& made the IOT devices hot pluggable \& dynamically configurable. Interface converts Rest API calls to retransmission and ACK supported custom MQTT UDP calls to IOT devices.
				\item \textbf{In Process Caching: Pubmatic} (2015).Implemented multi layer caching for Ad Servers,and their protocol in C. Increased AdServer platform throughput by 100\%.Implemented evictions, TCP interface, Cache Dump ,stripped locks for the LRU cache.
				
				\item \textbf{Web Bot Detection and Filtering: Pubmatic} (2014).Designed and Implemented 2 Realtime frameworks for protection against Web Bots and Crawlers in C using Trie \& Blooms. Contributed to 20\% of the BOTs detected by Pubmatic in RTB.

				\item \textbf{Realtime Feedback based throttling: Pubmatic} (2016).  Designed and Implemented a new throttling mechanism as part of a weekend hackathon based on realtime revenue and timeout feedbacks. The throttling kicks in when either our or partners platforms nears its peak capacity, maintaining systems revenue and availability.
